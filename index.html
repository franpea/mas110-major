        <h3>A Story About Hackers</h3>

		<p>Computer geeks don’t usually figure in the telling of the story of the rebellious sixties.  Maybe they should.  Not all geeks, of course.  Just a small group who changed the world in almost unimaginable and surprising ways.</p>
		<p>Steven Levy tells the story in “Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution”.  It was the late 1950s, early 1960s.  The scene: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or more specifically, the Tech Model Railway Club at MIT.  The members of this club became fascinated with a newly acquired computer, the TX-0.  In the course of their playful exploration of this computer a set of ideas and principles developed that eventually became known as the Hacker Ethic.</p>

	<h3>Hacker Ethics</h3>

		<button onclick="myFunction()">Hacker Ethics</button>
		<p id="ethics"></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!</li>
		<li>All information should be free.</li>
		<li>Mistrust authority–Promote decentralisation</li>
		<li>Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, sex, or position</li>
		<li>You can create art and beauty on a computer.</li>
		<li>Computers can change your life for the better.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What is the Linux kernel?</h3>

		<p>The kernel is the most important program in the set of programs that make up the operating system of a computer (Bovet & Cesati).  The operating system is the platform upon which user applications run and the kernel manages access to resources such as hard disk storage, random access memory and network bandwidth. The Linux kernel was created by Linus Torvalds and is licensed under the GNU General Public license.</p>

	<h3>Linus Torvalds</h3>
		<p>When he introduced the Linux kernel Torvalds clearly identified as a hacker and exhibited the traits of sharing for which they are known.  This is an excerpt from his 1991 post on a newsgroup (Moon & Sproull).</p>
		<p><blockquote>This is a program for hackers by a hacker. I've enjouyed [sic] doing it, and somebody might enjoy looking at it and even modifying it for their own needs. It is still small enough to understand, use and modify, and I'm looking forward to any comments you might have.</code></blockquote>

	<h3>Linux Kernel and Open Source</h3>
		<p>In their study of Linux kernel development, Lee and Cole (2003) describe how knowledge sharing is reinforced by the cultural norms of peer review and citation.  An author submits her work to other contributors for their review and is given credit for her work in the opening lines of source code files.  This can be seen as an extension of the notion that a hacker is judged by their hacking.  Everyone will know who’s responsible for which piece of code.</p>


	<h3>Hacker Army</h3>
		<p>According to Brown (2008) every computer science student becomes a hacker once they write their first program, the Hello World program, because “the collaborative nature of hacking infuses this inaugural program”. So looks like we should have a steady supply of hackers for some time to come.</p>
